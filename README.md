# Grindr Privacy Leaks

SVT and SINTEF conducted an experiment the 7th of February 2018 to analyse privacy leaks in the dating application Grindr. This was realised for the Sweedish TV program "Plus granskar", that you [may watch online.](https://www.svtplay.se/video/17267438/plus-granskar/plus-granskar-ditt-karleksliv-en-handelsvara)

We discovered that Grindr contains many trackers, and shares personal information with various third parties directly from the application.

### Grindr shares personal information including HIV Status with Apptimize and Localytics

### Grindr shares personal information without security

## Grindr contains trackers

By decompiling the Grindr Android source code, we discovered tracking software. Notably Facebook, Smatoop or Localytics. [This is also confirmed by the project Exodus.](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/reports/5323/)

## Experiment Setup

We installed Grindr on a Samsung Galaxy running Android and on an iPhone running iOS. Two persons created a Grindr profile and started dating.

We analysed the Grindr network traffic by using a man-in-the-middle proxy recording HTTP and HTTPS exchanges, using a setup similar to the one described in the paper ["Who knows what about me? A survey of behind the scenes personal data sharing to third parties by mobile apps." (Zang, K., Dummit, J., Graves, P.L. and Latanya, S.  - Technology Science (2015)."](https://techscience.org/a/2015103001/download.pdf) 
We used Wireshark to monitor all TCP/IP traffic, Fiddler to capture HTTP and HTTPS traffic, and APKTool to decompile the Android application.
